Documented behavior in camera scripts:

Most camera scripts have 70 track groups (5 tracks each), some have 40

Color order is ABGR


Path flags:
	00000040 - Unknown
	00000004 - Global channel

Director uses "Focus" type
Global Cmd uses "Cmd" type


Node flags:
	Always zero

Node types and "other-data" formats:
1: Never used

2: Cubic
	<Position> : <Velocity vector> : <Relative mode> : <Name>
	
	Relative mode:
		0: None
		1: Scaled Source
		2: Scaled Target
		3: Inscribed
		4: Circumscribed
		5: Fixed Source
		6: Fixed Target
		7: Fixed Inscribed

	<Value> : <Rate> : <Name>

4: Cmd
	<Command>

5: Never used

6: Focus
	<Focus target> : <Name>

	Focus target 0 is the first "cubic" path, cubic paths are offset every 5 tracks.
	"Use no focus" is 70 (Global director track?)

7: FOV
	<Value> : <Rate> : <Name>

8: Scale
	<Scale> : <Delta> : <Unknown (always 0)> : <Name>
