rdc is a new APE compiler

Some explanations of options:

-f <name>: Overrides the file name instead of detecting it from input.

dparse uses the filename to generate a hash which is used to auto-generate
switch labels for inline switches.  You can use this to set it to something
else.

-is <value>: Override inline switch value with a specific number instead of
             computing it from the file name.


-d: Enable all dparse compatibility options


-dm: dparse macro behavior

dparse macros use a simple substitution that applies anywhere.  For example:

#define HELLO "whatever"

choice "something HELLO something"

... will result in:

choice "something whatever something"

Additionally, dparse allows defines to appear anywhere, it replaces the
define text with spaces and a bug where the trailing quote is not skipped,
so this:
choice "hello #define MACRO "something"

... results in:
choice "hello                         "

Consequently, enabling -dm enables -dt too.



If you don't enable this option, rdc will expect macro values to be unquoted
and will only replace them when they appear as tokens.


-dc: dparse comment removal behavior

dparse removes comments from anywhere, including inside of strings, e.g.:

choice "hello /* comment */ hello"

... gets replaced with:

choice "hello               hello"

If you don't enable this option, rdc will only replace comments outside
of strings.


-dt: dparse top-level directive handling

This causes tokens before the first #window or #switch directive to be
ignored.


-dl: dparse labeled command handling

dparse doesn't strip trailing whitespace or characters from goto or
gosub commands after the label.  This affects a few labels that contain
garbage characters after the label (e.g. in tours2 and ballotine).
This turns on -dc too since it affects disassembled goto commands.

If this isn't enabled, rdc will require that label command parameters are
actually labels.


-dp: dparse operator precedence

In dparse, all operators have unique precedences.  In order, they are:
/  *  -  +  <=  >=  <  >  !=  ==  &&  ^^  ||

If you don't enable this, rdc will use C++ operator precedences, with
xor between and and or.
/  *
-  +
<=  >=  <  >
!=  ==
&&
^^
||

-ds: dparse set variable name handling

dparse supports a "simplified" syntax for "set" commands:
set <var name>
... which is equivalent to:
set <var name> = 1 + 0

Unfortunately, this also permits whitespace in the variable name, which lead
to numerous broken scripts, e.g.:
set BRAINTRAIN_INTRO 0 = 1 + 0

With this option enabled, rdc will support a single token after the variable
name and concatenate it with a space and the variable name, for compatibility
with decompiled Anachronox APE files.

If you don't enable this option, then the variable name must be a single
identifier and the token after must be an assign operator.


-dcam: dparse cam command behavior

If this is set, the first token after a "cam" command will be parsed as
quoteless string, ignoring punctuation characters.  In Anachronox's data,
there are several cam commands like:

cam to(pacogem2) from(PlayerChar0) lift(20)

... Unfortunately these incorrectly use "to(pacogem2)" as the camera name
instead of the "to" target.  If you don't enable -dcam, rdc will consider this
as an error.


-de: Permit invalidly-typed expressions.  If this is disabled, expressions
generally must evaluate to a float.

-nexp: Disallow exponents in float constants

-ds: Disallow escape characters in expression strings

-dparse: Enable all dparse compatibility options

-opt: Don't optimize constant expressions

-noexpfloat: Disallow float literals containing exponent syntax

-noemptycond: Disallow empty conditional blocks



rdc permits several things that dparse doesn't:
- "else" commands in windows are allowed (as long as the expression is valid)
- Empty "if"/"else" statement blocks are allowed

rdc disallows some things that dparse allows:
- Only identifiers are allowed as formatting arguments.  If a formatting
  argument contains whitespace after the first identifier, and is not followed
  by a comma, then rdc will throw an error.


rdc will produce slightly different output for functions to simplify the
expression parser.  With dparse, if you do:
set a = func_charinparty [ charname ]

... then dparse will emit this as if the source is a float variable named
"func_charinparty [ charname ]"
... but if you do:
set a = 0 + func_charinparty [ charname ]

... then it will compact the whitespace and emit it as if it's named:
"func_charinparty[charname]"
