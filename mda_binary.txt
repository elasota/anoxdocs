MDA files can contain binary blobs.

Format:


$<type>:<size>:<padded size>:<checksum>
&<lines>
...

Type: 4-character type ID
Size: Size
Padded size: Size with additional padding
Checksum: Checksum 

Data lines cap out at 76 ASCII characters, and the padded size is encoded.

If padded size is not a multiple of 3, then the data is padded with enough 0
bytes at the START to sum to a multiple of 3.

The 4:3 scheme is as follows: Given 3 input binary values:

aaaaaaAA BBBBbbbb CCcccccc

The output 6-bit values are:
aaaaaa AABBBB bbbbCC cccccc

The 6-bit value to ASCII forward encoding is:
0..9   -> '0'..'9'
10..35 -> 'A'..'Z'
36..61 -> 'a'..'z'
62     -> '.'
63     -> '/'

Checksum computation:
a = adler32(0,0,0)
b = adler32(a,&type,4)
c = adler32(b,&littleEndian(size),4)
checksum = adler32(c,data,size)
