Air resistance behavior:
Maximum distance traveled is inversely proportional to air resistance

At air resistance 1, a particle that would travel 100 units over 10 seconds travels 20 instead
At air resistance 2, it will travel 1 unit

Seems to follow linear air resistance formula where mass = 2.

If air resistance(b) and acceleration(a) are non-zero:
vel = (initialVel - am/b)*e^(-bt/m) + am/b
pos = initialPos + m/b * (initialVel - am/b)(1 - e^(-bt/m)) + amt/b 

If air resistance is zero:
vel = initialVel + at
pos = initialPos + initialVel*t + (a*t^2)/2

If acceleration is zero:
vel = initialVel*e^(-bt/m)
pos = initialPos + m/b * initialVel*(1 - e^(-bt/m))



Non-obvious entries in APD text format:

genrotate : <Min rotation rate> : <Max rotation rate> : <Randomize initial angle flag>

Positive rotation rates are clockwise.  A rotation rate of 1 is once per second.



gennorm : <normal type>
0 = Face screen (default)
1 = Face up
2 = Face direction of generator
3 = Face screen, align particle Y axis with up vector
4 = Face screen, align particle Y axis with generator direction
5 = Face screen, align particle Y axis with generator direction flattened against XY plane

Scene orientation is such that if the particle is facing up, and the camera is facing
the particle looking down, with the particle in its image orientation, Y will be up
on the camera plane, and X will be right.



genloop : <number of loops limit> : <Unknown (possibly "pre-roll script on initialization")>

Limits number of times generator can run


genrandloop : <msec min> : <msec max>

Described as "force next loop of all generators when this one is between <msec min> and <msec max>"


genvol : <x> : <y> : <z> : <scale flow rate with dimensions>

Spawns within volume based on flags.

TBD: How "scale flow rate with dimensions" works.
